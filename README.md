# IMUnipi

IMUnipi is a university project. This project wanted us to recreate IMDb with some differences. First of all, we had to create our own  layout that shouldn't be the same as the original site. Also, instead of movies we rate video clips.
## Programming Languages

We used C#, ASP.NET and CSS.
